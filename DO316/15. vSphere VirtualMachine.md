### Prepare the Lab.
### I am using Red Hat Lab, so I am creating the default LAB of Redhat. If you don't have Redhat's lab then create a NFS server on one machine and export the directory.
```
lab start advanced-import
```

# Import a vSphere VirtualMachine
- One or more VirtualMachine images are available for browsing from your workstation system using the command: `elinks dump utility.lab.example.com:/exports-ocp4/ova` images
- Import the VirtualMachine called rhel9-web according to the following requirements:
- The imported VirtualMachine exists in the `vms-import` project
- The network of the source VirtualMachine has been mapped to the `pod network` of the imported VirtualMachine.
- The imported VirtualMachine used the `ocs-external-storagecluster-ceph-rbd-virtualization` storage class
- The imported VirtualMachine must be in running state.
- VM has two networks: one that is using the `pod networking`, and the other that is using the `default/vm-private-net` network.
- SSH to `utility` machine and curl the imported VM IP.

At the end, Go to the project `vms-import`, then start the VM and check the IP address.

### Curl the IP address
```
[student@workstation ~]$ ssh lab@utility
[lab@utility ~]$ curl 192.168.51.101
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello from VMware virtual machine!</h1>
    <small>Provisioned on VMware ESXi 8.0.1</small>
  </body>
</html>
[lab@utility ~]$
```
